# Conservative-Q-Learning-CQL-and-Implicit-Q-Learning-IQL-made-easy---PyTorch
Conservative Q-Learning and Implicit Q-Learning implemented in Torch in a way that you can read what I've done without going between files too much. 
If you wanna run the files, just create a TrainingX object, and then call the training loop method. The data for the loop method should be a StaticData object from memory.py.\
If you have any comments, contact me -
